The Data

The data comes from Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

The analysis contains the following files:
  X_train.txt, X_test.txt - containing recorded obsvations (training and testing datasets);
  Y_train.txt, Y_test.txt - containing activity labels 1-6 referring on the daily activity the subject was performing (training and testing datasets); 
  subject_train.txt, subject_train.txt - containing an identifier for each volunteer (1-30, training and testing datasets);
  features - containing the variable names for the datasets of observations; and
  activity labels - a table showing the activities corresponding to the numbers in the Y_train and Y_test files.
  
Variables
  
  Activity: 1-6
    Each volunteeer performed six activities, activity number corresponds to these activities.
    
  Subject: 1-30, integers
    The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.
  
  Labels:
  A 2*6 vector containing the activity labels:
    WALKING,
    WALKING_UPSTAIRS,
    WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS,
    SITTING,
    STANDING,
    LAYING.
    
  Features: 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.

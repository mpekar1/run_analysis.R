The Data

The data comes from Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

The analysis contains the following files:
  X_train.txt, X_test.txt - containing recorded obsvations (training and testing datasets);
  Y_train.txt, Y_test.txt - containing activity labels 1-6 referring on the daily activity the subject was performing (training and testing datasets); 
  subject_train.txt, subject_train.txt - containing an identifier for each volunteer (1-30, training and testing datasets);
  features - containing the variable names for the datasets of observations; and
  activity labels - a table showing the activities corresponding to the numbers in the Y_train and Y_test files.
  
Variables
  
  Subject: 1-30, integers
    The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.
  
  Activity:
  Each volunteer performed six activities, a 'activity' contains the following activity labels:
    WALKING,
    WALKING_UPSTAIRS,
    WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS,
    SITTING,
    STANDING,
    LAYING.
    
  Features: 

  Contains mean ('-Mean-')and standard deviation ('Std-')of time and frequency domain variables.
  Data was captured using embedded accelerometer and gyroscope. 
  The data contains 3-axial linear acceleration ( '-X', '-Y' and '-Z' directions) 
  and 3-axial angular velocity ('angleX', 'angleY' and 'angleZ') at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
  The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 
  The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, 
  where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
  The sensor signals (accelerometer ['-Acc-'] and gyroscope ['-Gyro-') were pre-processed 
  by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window).
  The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational ('-Gravity-') 
  and body motion ('-Body-') components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity.
  The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, 
  therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. 
  From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time ('t-') 
  and frequency ('f-') domain.

  Using the notation above the tidy dataset contains the following 86 variables:
